# Blogs

This repository contains the Markdown source and assets for the blog at [blog.ashrhmn.com](https://blog.ashrhmn.com).

## Repo Structure

> **Note:** Only `.md` files at the root are parsed into static HTML; everything in `assets/` is available to reference

## How It Works

- **Static HTML Build**  
  Each top-level `.md` file is converted into a static HTML page.
- **Automatic Deployment**  
  After any changes are merged here, the site rebuilds and updates automatically at [blog.ashrhmn.com](https://blog.ashrhmn.com).

## Contributing

2. **Branch** off for your edits.
3. **Edit** or **add** `.md` files at the root (and any related assets in `assets/`).
4. **Push** your branch and open a **Pull Request** against `main`.

Merged changes will go live automatically on the site.
